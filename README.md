# More Asteroid Resources, Forked

This project aims to add stone, uranium, lithium, holmium, and tungsten to asteroid processing recipes, allowing the user to add them to the current processing recipes, or add them as new recipes altogether. The goal of this is to allow space platforms to become almost independent (Curse you Gleba. I'll make a way to make carbon fiber in space) from planets, with the end goal of my projects with Factorio Space Age to make a edge-of-system start on a platform, or something to that end.

Currently, the default will be to add a research and new recipes that increase yield and output of asteroid processing, requiring two chunks instead of the one.

It's a fork of https://github.com/yuyaryshev/factoriomod_More-Asteroid-Resources because they did most of the work already and this isn't a very advanced mod so might as well give them 99% of the credit. I'm just going to be changing recipies, configs and adding two things. Definitely unique. The design is very human.
