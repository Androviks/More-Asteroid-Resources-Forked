# More Asteroid Resources, Forked

This project aims to add stone and uranium to asteroid processing recipes, allowing the user to add them to the current processing recipes, or add them as new recipes altogether.
The 1.1.X release now includes Promethium processing for fluid chemical outputs.
Currently, the default will be to add a research and new recipes that increase yield and output of asteroid processing, requiring two chunks instead of the one.

It's a fork of https://github.com/yuyaryshev/factoriomod_More-Asteroid-Resources because they did most of the work already and this isn't a very advanced mod so might as well give them 99% of the credit. I'm just going to be changing recipies, configs and adding two things. Definitely unique. The design is very human.
