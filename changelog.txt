Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2024-11-15
  Major Features:
    - Recipe/tech for Promethium chunks and other asteroids, to obtain chemical compounds from them. Who knows what they're made of.
      It comes after Promethium Science is unlocked and uses chunks directly in machines skipping crushers, for fluid outputs.
    - Metallic chunks react with promethium to create lava instead of ore, tungsten, and holmium solution.
      Found in the Foundry.
    - Carbonic chunks react with promethium to create heavy oil, light oil, and petroleum gas,
      in the inverse ratio that cracking crude does, as most light products would evaporate in space. Returns the loss as sulfur.
      Found in the Oil refinery.
    - Oxide chunks react with promethium to create ammoniacal solution, lithium brine, fluorine, and calcite.
      Found in the Cryogenics plant.
  Bugfixes:
    - Correct Changelog.txt syntax, maybe? Hopefully. No indents here thanks.
