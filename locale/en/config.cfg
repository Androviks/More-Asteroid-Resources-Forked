processing-mode=[font=default-bold]Standalone:[/font] Only add the standalone recipes for stone and uranium. (this is the default)\n[font=default-bold]Advanced crushing:[/font] Add the standalone recipes, but also add low yields to advanced crushing\n[font=default-bold]All:[/font] Add the standalone, add low yield to advanced, and add even lower yield to default crushing recipes. This is not recommended as it will bring most space platforms to a standstill shortly.
